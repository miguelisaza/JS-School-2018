## Requisites:

- Bookshelf Server running on `localhost:8000`

Check the Server docks here: [Server Documentation]()

```
$ npm install
```

Be sure that the server is running and their data it's already populated to the DB, then type the following command to run the app:

```
$ npm start
```

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
