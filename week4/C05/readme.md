## JS Bookshelf

### All requests and stuff were made with vanilla JS except tooltips.


JSON model stored in `data/bookshelf.json` 

`index.html` is a login screen.

`main.html` is the bookshelf.

ES6 code was transpiled using Babel. Gulp wad for monitoring those ES6 files. 

It's necessary to do a `npm install` in order to make things work.
